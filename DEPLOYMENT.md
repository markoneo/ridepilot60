# Deployment Guide for RidePilot

Your RidePilot app is a full-stack application that needs both frontend and backend hosting. Here are the best deployment options:

## Recommended: Vercel (Full-Stack Support)

### Why Vercel is Best for Your App
- Supports full-stack Next.js/React + API routes
- Automatic serverless functions
- Easy GitHub integration
- Built-in environment variable management

### Deploy to Vercel Steps:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your `ridepilot-transport-management` repository
5. Configure environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anonymous key
   - `DATABASE_URL` = your PostgreSQL connection string
6. Click "Deploy"

## Alternative: Netlify (Frontend Only + Serverless Functions)

If you prefer Netlify, I've configured it for you, but you'll need to:

### Netlify Setup:
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
4. Environment variables (same as above)
5. Deploy

### Important for Netlify:
- Your API routes will be at `/.netlify/functions/server/api/...`
- The app is configured with serverless functions
- May have cold start delays

## Option 3: Railway/Render (Full Server Hosting)

For traditional server hosting:

### Railway:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy automatically

### Render:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create new "Web Service"
3. Connect repository
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Start command: `npm start`

## Environment Variables Required

For any platform, you need these environment variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Getting Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Open your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API
4. Copy:
   - Project URL (for VITE_SUPABASE_URL)
   - Public anon key (for VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

## Troubleshooting Netlify 404 Error

The 404 error you saw happens because:
1. Netlify tried to serve your React app as static files
2. Your app needs a server for the Express backend
3. The `netlify.toml` file I created fixes this

If you still get 404 errors on Netlify:
1. Check the build log for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Make sure the build command completed successfully

## Recommended Solution

For the easiest deployment with your current setup, I recommend **Vercel** because:
- It handles full-stack apps perfectly
- No complex configuration needed
- Excellent performance
- Free tier is generous

Would you like me to help you set up deployment on Vercel instead of Netlify?
