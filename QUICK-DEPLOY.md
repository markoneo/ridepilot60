# Quick Deployment Fix for RidePilot

Netlify is designed for static websites, but RidePilot needs a server for your Express backend and database connections.

## Best Solution: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Vercel
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and choose "Continue with GitHub"

### Step 2: Import Your Project
1. Click "Add New Project"
2. Find your `ridepilot-transport-management` repository
3. Click "Import"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Click "Environment Variables" and add these:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_supabase_anon_key
DATABASE_URL = your_postgresql_connection_string
```

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Leave all other settings as default
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

## Your Supabase Credentials
To get these values:
1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Open your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API
4. Copy the Project URL and anon public key

2. Share the Replit URL with users
3. Upgrade to Replit Pro for custom domains
